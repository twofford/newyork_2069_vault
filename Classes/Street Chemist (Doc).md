# Street Chemist (Doc)

The Street Chemist focuses on cooking drugs that help their allies and hinder their enemies.

## Let Her Cook

Beginning at first level, you know how to produce street drugs. You know the following recipes: Sandman I, Flash, Sway I, Surge, and IQ I. You may create or learn new recipes as you play. Creating street drugs requires proficiency in Chemistry Tools, time, and ingredients. See the Street Drugs table for time and ingredient requirements. Some street drugs require a lab to produce. You start with proficiency in Chemistry Tools and a set of said tools. Each time you level up, you learn one new recipe of your choice.

## Not FDA Approved

You know how to cut stimulants with street drugs to make them more effective, at a cost. Starting at first level, when you use your Basic Healing or Quick Heal abilities, you may roll double the dice you normally would, but the target gains the poisoned condition. You may use this ability twice per long rest.

## Bespoke Benzos

Starting at third level, you can give drugs you cook special properties from the Custom Formulas table. You can apply one custom formula to each drug you cook.
