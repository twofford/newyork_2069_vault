OKB-2186, nicknamed "Nachthexen" or "Nochnyye Ved'my" (Night Witches) is a Soviet version of a biotech startup. Partially state-funded (as most businesses are in the USSR), partially a criminal enterprise, Nachthexen is a relatively small industrial collective of about 75 people, focused on the development of niche drugs and adjacent medical technology. They are also responsible for supplying most of the queer population of the eastern bloc with various drugs and surgeries.

Nachthexen's illicit drug operation is an important source of additional funding, and a few well placed bribes mostly keeps the authorities off their back.
